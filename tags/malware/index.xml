      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a detour down the rabbit hole of malware development (as one does&amp;hellip;) and I think it deserves a look if you work in cybersecurity. The inspiration for this comes from the MalDev Academy main modules for developing malware. After working through some of the material again I wanted to share some interesting things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and observed as it relates to malware detection.
Specifically we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at how payload encryption and binary signing significantly reduces detection rates based on tests with VirusTotal.</description>
