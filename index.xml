      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a detour down the rabbit hole of malware development (as one does&amp;hellip;) and I think it deserves a look if you work in cybersecurity. The inspiration for this comes from the MalDev Academy main modules for developing malware. After working through some of the material again I wanted to share some interesting things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and observed as it relates to malware detection.
Specifically we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at how payload encryption and binary signing significantly reduces detection rates based on tests with VirusTotal.</description>

      <description>WordPress has been my latest rabbit hole for hacking and bug bounty.

Up until this point I&amp;rsquo;ve only hunted for bugs occasionally on public bug bounty programs with marginal success. Fast forward to today and I am completely zoned in on WordPress plugins and having the most success (and fun!</description>

      <description>Hi 👋, I&amp;rsquo;m Heath aka ghsinfosec. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start getting serious about cybersecurity until I was about 32. It all started with a YouTube video by a guy named John Hammond. You may have heard of him 😏 &amp;hellip; After a few years of consistent failure I could almost consider myself a mediocre hacker security researcher, occasional CTF player, and I find myself jumping down rabbit holes probably more often than I care to admit.</description>
